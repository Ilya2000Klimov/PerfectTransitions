## Project Summary

A short paragraph outlining the main idea of the project (see further
instructions here: https://royf.org/crs/CS175/W25/proposal.pdf). You now have
a better sense of what your project is about than you did in the proposal, so update and clarify
beyond that version. Do not change your proposal page! (A few of you have already changed
it to reflect a change of topic, but don’t change it further, rather keep it as it was at the time
you locked down your topic).

## Approach

Give a detailed description of your approach, in a few of paragraphs (at least a
couple). You should summarize the main algorithm you are using, such as by writing out how
it samples data and the equations of the loss(es) it optimizes (you can copy this information
from scientific publications or online resources, in which case cite them clearly. The default
GitHub Pages we shared includes an example of redering math within Markdown). You
should also give details about the approach as it applies to your scenario, such as how you set
up inputs and outputs (e.g. states / observations, actions, and rewards), how much data you
use (e.g. for how many interaction steps you train), and the values of any hyperparameters
(cite your source for default hyperparameter values, and for any changed values detail if and
how you tune them and the numbers you end up using). A good guideline is to incorporate
sufficient details so that most of your approach is reproducible by a reader. You’re encouraged
to use figures for this, as appropriate, e.g. as we used in the exercises.

## Evaluation

An important aspect of your project, as we mentioned in the beginning, is
evaluating your project. Be clear and precise about describing the evaluation setup, for both
quantitative and qualitative results. Present the results to convince the reader that you have a
working implementation. Use plots, charts, tables, screenshots, figures, etc. as appropriate.
For each type of evaluation that you perform, you’ll probably need at least 1 or 2 paragraphs
(excluding figures etc.) to describe it.

## Remaining Goals and Challenges

### Crossfade

### Interactive Interface

### Music app integration

In a few paragraphs, describe your goals for the remainder
of the quarter. At the very least, describe how you consider your prototype to be limited,
and what you want to add to make it a complete contribution. Note that if you think your
algorithm is working well enough, but have not performed sufficient evaluation to gain insight,
doing this should be a goal. Similarly, you may propose comparing with other algorithms
/ approaches / manually tailored solutions (when feasible) that you did not get a chance to
implement, but can enrich your discussion in the final report. Finally, given your experience
so far, describe some of the challenges you anticipate facing by the time your final report is
due, to what degree you expected to become obstacles, and what you might try in order to
overcome them.

## Resources Used

Mention all the resources that you found useful in writing your implemen-
tation. This should include everything like code documentation, AI/ML libraries, source
code that you used, StackOverflow, etc. You do not have to be comprehensive, but it is
important to report the sources that are crucial to your project. One aspect that does need to
be comprehensive is a description of any use you made of AI tools.
